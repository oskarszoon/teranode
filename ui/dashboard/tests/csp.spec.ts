/**
 * The production Content-Security-Policy, asserted by a browser that is actually enforcing it.
 *
 * The Go unit test compares the served header against the package constant; that proves the string
 * is emitted, not that a browser does what the string is meant to make it do. These tests fulfil a
 * real document with the real header from the preview origin, then exercise the two behaviours the
 * policy is supposed to have (bitcoin-sv/teranode#4844):
 *
 *  - a ws:// websocket to ANOTHER host is NOT blocked. The dashboard drives remote teranode
 *    instances, and a cross-origin ws:// URL is covered only by the listed ws: scheme, never by
 *    'self' or https:. So this assertion fails if ws: is dropped from connect-src. (A same-origin
 *    target would not: Chromium treats 'self' as covering a same-origin ws:// URL.) The block is
 *    detected by the securitypolicyviolation event naming connect-src, NOT by a constructor throw:
 *    Chromium fails a connect-src-blocked WebSocket asynchronously, so a SecurityError check never
 *    fires. A positive control runs the same attempt under the policy with ws: removed and requires
 *    the violation, so the detector cannot go blind without this file failing. wss: is listed only
 *    as belt and braces over https:, which CSP3 scheme matching lets cover wss:// as well, so no
 *    browser check could fail when it is dropped; that token is guarded as a string instead.
 *  - a remote module import IS blocked, BY THE POLICY. The module is served from the test itself,
 *    with the CORS header a cross-origin module import requires, and a separate positive control
 *    shows it genuinely loading when no policy is served — so "blocked" cannot be satisfied by a
 *    network or CORS failure. The refusal is further confirmed by a securitypolicyviolation event
 *    naming script-src. That import is the amplification step a coinbase-sized payload needs, and
 *    blocking it is the main thing this policy buys against the reported attack.
 *
 * Runs under `npm run test:integration`, NOT `npm run test:unit`. CI must run it.
