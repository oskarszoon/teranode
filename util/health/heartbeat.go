// Heartbeat records the last time a loop proved it could still make progress,
// so a liveness probe can tell a wedged service from a healthy one (issue 1447).
//
// The distinction that makes this safe is WHAT gets recorded. A heartbeat must
// mean "this loop is still servicing its work channel", NOT "this loop did
// useful work" — a node with no blocks arriving is perfectly healthy, and on
// mainnet the gap between blocks is routinely tens of minutes. Loops therefore
// beat on a periodic tick inside the same select they service work on: if the
// loop is deadlocked, or wedged inside a handler, the tick cannot be served
// either and the heartbeat goes stale. That is exactly the silent freeze a
// liveness probe exists to catch, and it stays quiet when the node is merely
// idle.
//
// The zero value is usable and reports healthy until the first Beat, so a
// service that has not started its loop yet is never killed during startup.
// That matters more than it looks: a service is constructed during Init but its
// loop may not start until well into Start, behind work that is legitimately
// unbounded — waiting on pending block validation, reloading a large unmined
// set from disk. Beating before the loop owns the heartbeat would age it
// through that entire preamble and report a perfectly healthy, still-starting
// node as wedged; worse, a restart sends the node back through the same
// preamble, so it could never finish starting.
//
// The beat is stored as a time.Time rather than a plain unix-nanosecond count
// so it keeps its monotonic reading. Age therefore measures elapsed time, not
// wall-clock difference: an NTP correction or a host clock step cannot age the
// heartbeat past the timeout and restart a node that is working fine.

// BeatIfStarted records progress only once a loop has claimed the heartbeat
// with a first Beat, and does nothing before that.
//
// Work that can run BOTH during startup and from inside the loop must use this
// rather than Beat. Beating from the startup path would move the heartbeat off
// its never-beaten state part-way through a preamble that is legitimately
// unbounded, so the remainder of that preamble would age the heartbeat and the
// probe would report a healthy, still-starting node as wedged.
//
// It is also safe to call from a goroutine other than the one that calls
// Disable, and it never re-arms a heartbeat that Disable has cleared. The check
// and the store are one compare-and-swap, so a Disable that lands between them
// makes the swap fail, the retry sees the never-beaten state and returns. A
// plain load followed by a store would overwrite that Disable, and the
// heartbeat would then age through a graceful shutdown drain and fail the
// probe.

// Disable returns the heartbeat to its never-beaten state, so it reports
// healthy again and BeatIfStarted stops renewing it.
//
// A loop that exits deliberately, on shutdown, must call this on its way out.
// Otherwise the heartbeat keeps ageing after the loop is gone, and a health
// server that outlives the loop during a graceful drain reports a node that is
// stopping on purpose as wedged. On Kubernetes a failed liveness probe during
// termination kills the container at once instead of waiting out the grace
// period, which cuts that drain short.

// age that decision was made on. A deadline of zero or less disables the check,
// so an operator can turn the probe's restart behaviour off without redeploying
// different code.
//
// The age is returned rather than left to a second Age call so a caller can
// report the number the decision actually used. Reading twice would let the
// loop beat in between and produce a message that contradicts its own verdict
// — "has not made progress for 0s".
