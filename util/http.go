// was added to close: a hostile peer answering with an error status and streaming
// forever. So the drain is itself bounded. A body whose remainder fits is drained
// and its connection reused; anything larger is abandoned and Close tears the
// connection down, which is the correct outcome for a peer that streams
// unboundedly on an error status.

//     returns*. Every caller of buildHTTPError cancels its request context immediately
//     afterwards — DoHTTPRequest defers cancelFn, doHTTPRequestWithRetryAfter
//     calls it outright — and response-body reads honour that context. So a drain that
//     has not finished by then is killed and the connection is discarded: a purely
//     asynchronous drain delivers no reuse at all, which is the entire point of
//     draining.
//   - A peer that dribbles must not hold the caller. Body reads are otherwise bounded
//     only by the request context, up to the 5-minute streaming timeout, compounded by
//     up to six 503 retries.
//
// So the drain is synchronous up to this budget and abandoned past it. A peer whose
// remainder is already buffered — the common case for a verbose error page — drains in
// microseconds and its connection is reused; a dribbler costs the caller this much and
// no more.
//
// Across a retry ladder that budget multiplies: DoHTTPRequestBodyReaderWithRetry makes
// up to defaultRetryConfig.maxAttempts attempts, so its worst case is
// maxAttempts x this budget — 6 x 250ms = 1.5s — reached only against a peer that
// dribbles its error body on every one of the six attempts. Set that against the
// ~7.75s of exponential backoff the same ladder already spends between those attempts
// (250ms doubling, capped at 5s), and the added share is bounded enough that the

// and the right behavior is to back off and retry rather than fail the caller.
//
// Behavior:
//   - Retries only on errors satisfying errors.Is(err, errors.ErrServiceUnavailable) or
//     errors.Is(err, errors.ErrServiceRateLimited).
//   - Other errors (404, 500, network errors) are returned immediately — they are not
//     transient admission rejections.
//   - Backoff is exponential starting at 250ms, doubling, capped at 5s. Up to 6 attempts,
//     so a server that never relents and never sends Retry-After costs ~7.75s of backoff
//     before the final error.
//   - Honors the server's Retry-After header on each rejection, replacing that attempt's
//     ladder delay outright when the header value is <= maxDelay; a larger value is
//     ignored and the ladder delay is used instead. Retry-After is not a ceiling on top
//     of the ladder — a compliant peer sending Retry-After: 5 on every rejection costs
//     5 x 5s = 25s, well above the Retry-After-free worst case above.
//   - ctx cancellation aborts the retry loop and returns the parent ctx error.
//   - The final error keeps the classification of the last rejection, so a caller can
//     still tell a rate limit apart from an unavailable server after the ladder runs out.
//
// Each attempt is a new request built the same way as the plain path: a GET, or a POST
