## 1. Introduction

Teranode is designed as a collection of microservices that work together to provide a horizontally scalable and highly efficient blockchain network. The microservices architecture enables Teranode to achieve exceptional throughput exceeding 1 million transactions per second by distributing processing across multiple machines and allowing individual services to scale independently based on demand.

This architectural approach provides several key advantages:

- **Horizontal Scalability**: Services can be deployed across multiple machines, enabling the system to handle increasing transaction volumes by adding more compute resources
- **Independent Scaling**: Each service can be scaled independently based on its specific resource requirements and bottlenecks
- **Distributed Processing**: Work is distributed across specialized services that communicate asynchronously through Kafka and synchronously via gRPC
- **Fault Isolation**: Issues in one service are contained and don't cascade to affect the entire system
- **Technology Flexibility**: Each service can use the most appropriate technology stack and storage backend for its specific requirements

This document provides an overview of each microservice, its responsibilities, and how it interacts with other components in the system.

## 5. Other Components

### 5.1 Kafka Message Broker

Kafka serves as the messaging middleware for inter-service communication in Teranode.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Facilitate asynchronous communication between services
- Ensure reliable message delivery
- Support high-throughput data streaming

**Key Topics and Use Cases:**

- `kafka_validatortxsConfig`: Optional transport for new transaction notifications from Propagation to Validator. Empty by default in `settings.conf` and populated only in the `.operator` context; when empty, no producer and no consumer group are created and Propagation invokes the Validator directly. See [§6.1](#61-choosing-grpc-vs-kafka-for-a-new-communication-path)
- `kafka_txmetaConfig`: Used for sending new UTXO metadata from Validator to Subtree Validation
- `kafka_rejectedTxConfig`: Used for notifying P2P about rejected transactions
- `kafka_blocksConfig`: Used for propagating new blocks from P2P to Block Validation
- `kafka_subtreesConfig`: Used for sending new subtrees from P2P to Subtree Validation
- `kafka_blocksFinalConfig`: Used for sending finalized blocks from Blockchain to the Legacy P2P service (`netsync.SyncManager`). The Block Persister does **not** consume this topic — it polls the Blockchain service over gRPC (`GetBlocksNotPersisted`) instead
- `kafka_invalidBlocksConfig`: Used for notifying P2P about blocks that failed validation, for peer reputation management
- `kafka_invalidSubtreesConfig`: Used for notifying P2P about subtrees that failed validation, for peer quality tracking
- `kafka_txPolicyRejectedConfig`: Used for sending consensus-valid but policy-rejected transactions from Validator to Subtree Validation
- `kafka_legacyInvConfig`: Used by the Legacy Sync Manager to bridge legacy Bitcoin wire protocol inventory messages to and from Kafka

**Key Features:**

- Supports high-throughput data streaming
- Provides fault-tolerance and durability
- Allows for scalable message consumption

You can read more about how Kafka is used in the [Kafka usage documentation](../kafka/kafka.md).

### 5.2 Miners

Miners are responsible for the computational work of finding valid blocks.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Perform proof-of-work calculations
- Broadcast newly found blocks

## 6. Interaction Patterns

The Teranode microservices communicate through a combination of synchronous gRPC calls and asynchronous Kafka message streams, creating an event-driven architecture that enables high throughput and loose coupling between components.

**Transaction Processing Flow:**

- Propagation Service receives incoming transactions from the network through multiple channels (gRPC, HTTP, UDP multicast) and hands each transaction to the Validator. That handoff runs over the `kafka_validatortxsConfig` topic only when the topic is configured; it is empty in the committed defaults, and with `useLocalValidator = true` (also the committed default) Propagation calls an in-process Validator directly
- Validator Service validates transactions against Bitcoin consensus rules and network policies, updates the UTXO Store with transaction metadata, and publishes the resulting UTXO metadata to Kafka (`kafka_txmetaConfig`) for Subtree Validation
- Block Assembly Service does **not** consume from Kafka: the Validator calls it directly over gRPC (`AddTx` / `AddTxBatch`, via `blockAssembler.Store()`), because the transaction must land in the current mining candidate before the caller proceeds. Block Assembly organizes the transactions it receives into subtrees for efficient block construction and mining
- Subtree Validation Service validates newly received subtrees and coordinates with the Validator Service for any missing transaction data

**Block Processing Flow:**

- P2P Service receives new blocks and subtrees from peer nodes and propagates them via Kafka to the Block Validation and Subtree Validation services
- Block Validation Service coordinates with the Subtree Validation Service to verify all subtrees within a block, ensuring data integrity before acceptance
- Blockchain Service maintains the blockchain state machine, managing block additions, chain reorganizations, and finality determinations
- When a block is finalized, Blockchain Service publishes it via Kafka (`blocks-final`) to the Legacy P2P service, which uses it to announce new blocks to legacy (pre-libp2p) peers. The Block Persister does not consume this topic; it polls the Blockchain service over gRPC (`GetBlocksNotPersisted`) for blocks awaiting long-term storage

**Data Access Patterns:**

- Asset Server provides a unified HTTP/WebSocket interface for querying blockchain data, acting as a facade over the UTXO Store, Blob Store, and Blockchain Store
- UTXO Store serves as a central state management component, interacting with multiple services (Validator, Block Assembly, Block Validation) for UTXO operations and double-spend prevention
- Blob Store provides persistent storage for transactions and subtrees, accessed by Asset Server, Block Assembly, and Block Validation services

### 6.1 Choosing gRPC vs. Kafka for a New Communication Path

When adding a new communication path between services, pick the transport based on what
the path actually needs, not on convenience or precedent alone. There are three options in
Teranode, not two &mdash; gRPC request/response, the Blockchain notification stream, and Kafka:

- **Use gRPC** when the call is synchronous request/response and the caller cannot make
  progress until it gets a result (success/failure, or a value it needs right now).
  Examples already in the codebase:
    - Validator &rarr; Block Assembly `Store()`: the Validator calls Block Assembly directly over
      gRPC (not Kafka) because the transaction must land in the current mining candidate
      without delay, and the caller needs to know the call succeeded.
    - Block Validation / Block Assembly &rarr; Blockchain `AddBlock`: the caller needs to know
      whether the block was accepted before proceeding (e.g. to mark it mined).
    - Block Validation &rarr; Subtree Validation `CheckBlockSubtrees`: validation cannot continue
      until it learns whether the referenced subtrees are known/valid.
- **Use the Blockchain notification subscription** when the event is a chain-state change
  that several services need to hear about &mdash; block added, block invalidated, reorg, FSM
  transition. This is a gRPC *server-streaming* RPC, `rpc Subscribe (SubscribeRequest)
  returns (stream Notification)` (`services/blockchain/blockchain_api/blockchain_api.proto`),
  and `SendNotification` on the Blockchain server broadcasts to all active subscribers
  without blocking on any of them. Seven services subscribe today: P2P, Block Assembly,
  Block Validation, Subtree Validation, Asset (main-chain cache), UTXO Persister and
  Pruner. Prefer this over introducing a new Kafka topic for chain-state fan-out &mdash;
  there is no broker or topic configuration to add, and every service that needs it
  already holds a blockchain client.
- **Use Kafka** when the path is asynchronous, fire-and-forget, one-to-many, or the
  producer does not need to know whether or when a consumer processes the message.
  Examples already in the codebase:
    - Validator &rarr; Subtree Validation (`kafka_txmetaConfig`) and Validator &rarr; P2P
      (`kafka_rejectedTxConfig`): notifications that the Validator emits without caring who
      consumes them or when.
    - P2P &rarr; Block Validation / Subtree Validation (`kafka_blocksConfig`, `kafka_subtreesConfig`):
      network events fanned out for eventual processing, decoupling ingestion rate from
      validation rate.
    - Blockchain &rarr; Legacy P2P (`kafka_blocksFinalConfig`): a finalized block is announced to
      legacy (pre-libp2p) peers by `netsync.SyncManager`; the producer does not wait for, or
      learn about, delivery. Note this is the topic's *only* real consumer &mdash; the Block
      Persister does **not** consume it, it polls the Blockchain service over gRPC
      (`GetBlocksNotPersisted`), waking every `blockpersister_persistSleep` (default 10s),
      because it needs to drive its own pace and record progress back to the Blockchain
      service. Long-running "queue it for eventual heavy work" paths in Teranode are pull
      loops, not topics.
    - Propagation &rarr; Validator (`kafka_validatortxsConfig`) &mdash; *opt-in, off in the committed
      defaults*: when the topic is configured, Propagation hands off a new transaction and
      moves on without waiting for validation. `kafka_validatortxsConfig` is empty in
      `settings.conf` and populated only in the `.operator` context; when it is empty no
      producer and no consumer group are created. On top of that, `useLocalValidator = true`
      is the committed default, so `daemon/daemon_stores.go` hands Propagation an in-process
      `*Validator` rather than a gRPC stub &mdash; the default path is a function call, not a
      network hop. This is the one path in the codebase where the transport is a *deployment*
      decision rather than a design decision.

**Rule of thumb:** if the calling code needs the result before it can proceed (or needs
to know the call failed), use gRPC. If the event is a chain-state change that several
services react to, use the Blockchain `Subscribe` stream. If the producer only needs to
announce that something happened, and doesn't care who's listening or when they get to it,
use Kafka. Before committing to Kafka, check these four things:

- **Fan-out is per consumer group, not per consumer.** Within one group, each partition is
  assigned to a single instance, so exactly one instance sees each message &mdash; that is how
  a consumer scales horizontally. To have several *independent* consumers each see every
  message, each needs its own group ID: `daemon/daemon_services.go` builds per-service
  group IDs, while `daemon/daemon_kafka.go` deliberately appends a random per-process
  suffix to the `txmeta` group so every Subtree Validation pod consumes the full stream.
  Getting this backwards produces either duplicated work or a silent single-instance
  bottleneck.
- **Durability is bounded by the topic's retention, not by "Kafka is persistent".**
  `kafka_blocksConfig`, `kafka_blocksFinalConfig`, `kafka_txmetaConfig` and the `.operator`
  `kafka_validatortxsConfig` are all `retention=60000` (60 s) in `settings.conf`; only
  `kafka_subtreesConfig` (30 min) and `kafka_rejectedTxConfig` (10 min) give a meaningful
  window. A consumer down for longer than the retention drops messages rather than catching
  up. If a new path must tolerate longer outages, raise retention deliberately or design an
  explicit catch-up path (as the Block Persister does with `GetBlocksNotPersisted`).
- **Payload size has a ceiling.** `validator_kafka_maxMessageBytes` is ~1 MB (1048576 code
  default, 1048500 in `settings.conf`), matching the Kafka broker default, and Propagation
  already needs an HTTP fallback for transactions above it &mdash; `validateTransactionViaHTTP`,
  which hard-fails when no validator HTTP endpoint is configured. The Blockchain service
  also warns when a `blocks-final` message crosses 500 KB. If a new path can carry payloads
  near that limit, either keep the message a reference (hash + metadata, payload in a store)
  or plan the fallback leg up front.
- **Kafka orders messages only within a partition.** A path that needs global ordering is
  therefore limited to one partition, which caps how far a consumer group can be scaled out
  &mdash; partitions are the unit of parallelism within a group. Ordering is not recoverable by
  tuning after the fact: it forces either a single partition or a redesign.
  `settings.conf` carries the comment "tx validation order is critical so we cannot have
  mutiple partitions" [sic] above `kafka_validatortxsConfig`, though the `.operator` URL
  that follows it is configured with `partitions=${KAFKA_PARTITIONS_HIGH}` (8) &mdash; treat
  ordering as something to establish for your own path rather than something inherited.
