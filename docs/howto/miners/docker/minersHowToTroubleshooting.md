## Introduction

This guide provides troubleshooting steps for common issues encountered while running Teranode with Docker Compose.



## Troubleshooting



### Health Checks and System Monitoring



#### Service Status


```bash
docker compose ps
```
This command lists all services defined in your docker-compose.yml file, along with their current status (Up, Exit, etc.) and health state if health checks are configured.



#### Detailed Container/Pod Health



```bash
docker inspect --format='{{json .State.Health}}' container_name
```

Replace `container_name` with the name of your specific Teranode service container. For example:


```bash
docker inspect --format='{{json .State.Health}}' asset
```



#### Monitoring System Resources


* Use `docker stats` to monitor CPU, memory, and I/O usage of containers:
  ```bash
  docker stats
  ```


* Consider using Prometheus and Grafana for comprehensive monitoring.
* Look for services consuming unusually high resources.



##### Viewing Global Logs





```bash
docker compose logs
docker compose logs -f  # Follow logs in real-time
docker compose logs --tail=100  # View only the most recent logs
```




##### Viewing Logs for Specific Microservices





```bash
docker compose logs [service_name]
```



##### Useful Options for Log Viewing





* Show timestamps:
  ```bash
  docker compose logs -t
  ```
* Limit output:
  ```bash
  docker compose logs --tail=50 [service_name]
  ```
* Since time:
  ```bash
  docker compose logs --since 2023-07-01T00:00:00 [service_name]
  ```




##### Checking Logs for Specific Teranode Microservices

```bash
docker compose logs [service_name]
```

For Docker Compose, replace `[service_name]` with the appropriate service or pod name:

* Propagation Service (service name: `propagation`)
* Blockchain Service (service name: `blockchain`)
* Asset Service (service name: `asset`)
* Block Validation Service (service name: `blockvalidation`)
* P2P Service (service name: `p2p`)
* Block Assembly Service (service name: `blockassembly`)
* Subtree Validation Service (service name: `subtreevalidation`)
* RPC Server (service name: `rpc`)
* Postgres Database (service name: `postgres`)          [*Only in Docker*]
* Aerospike Database (service name: `aerospike`)        [*Only in Docker*]
* Kafka   (service name: `kafka-shared`)                [*Only in Docker*]
* Kafka Console (service name: `kafka-console-shared`)  [*Only in Docker*]
* Prometheus (service name: `prometheus`)               [*Only in Docker*]
* Grafana  (service name: `grafana`)                    [*Only in Docker*]


##### Redirecting Logs to a File


```bash
docker compose logs > teranode_logs.txt
docker compose logs [service_name] > [service_name]_logs.txt
```



Remember to replace placeholders like `[service_name]`, and label selectors with the appropriate values for your Teranode setup.



#### **Check Services Dashboard**



Check your Grafana `TERANODE Service Overview` dashboard:



- Check that there's no blocks in the queue (`Queued Blocks in Block Validation`). We expect little or no queueing, and not creeping up. 3 blocks queued up are already a concern.



- Check that the propagation instances are handling around the same load to make sure the load is equally distributed among all the propagation servers. See the `Propagation Processed Transactions per Instance` diagram.



- Check that the cache is at a sustainable pattern rather than "exponentially" growing (see both the `Tx Meta Cache in Block Validation` and `Tx Meta Cache Size in Block Validation` diagrams).



- Check that go routines (`Goroutines` graph) are not creeping up or reaching excessive levels.



### Recovery Procedures



#### Third Party Component Failure



Teranode is highly dependent on its third party dependencies. Postgres, Kafka and Aerospike are critical for Teranode operations, and the node cannot work without them.



If a third party service fails, you must restore its functionality. Once it is back, please restart Teranode cleanly following the instructions in the [How to Start and Stop Teranode in Docker](minersHowToStopStartDockerTeranode.md) guide.
