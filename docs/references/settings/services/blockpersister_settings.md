# Block Persister Service Settings

**Related Topic**: [Block Persister Service](../../../topics/services/blockPersister.md)

## Configuration Settings

Settings are organized under the `BlockPersister` struct in `settings.Settings`.

| Setting | Type | Default | Environment Variable | Usage |
|---------|------|---------|---------------------|-------|
| Store | *url.URL | "file://./data/blockstore" | blockpersister_store | **CRITICAL** - Block data storage location |
| HTTPListenAddress | string | "127.0.0.1:8083" | blockpersister_httpListenAddress | HTTP server for blob store access |
| HTTPAuthToken | string | "" | blockpersister_httpAuthToken | **CRITICAL** - bearer token required for blob HTTP writes; unset means read-only |
| Concurrency | int | 8 | blockpersister_concurrency | **CRITICAL** - Parallel subtree processing, reduced by half in all-in-one mode |
| SkipUTXODelete | bool | false | blockpersister_skipUTXODelete | Skip UTXO deletion processing |
| PersistSleep | time.Duration | 10s | blockpersister_persistSleep | Sleep duration when no blocks available or after errors |
| ProcessUTXOFiles | bool | true | blockpersister_processUTXOFiles | Enable UTXO additions/deletions file generation |

### Related Settings (from Block struct)

| Setting | Type | Default | Environment Variable | Usage |
|---------|------|---------|---------------------|-------|
| ProcessTxMetaUsingStoreBatchSize | int | 1024 | blockvalidation_processTxMetaUsingStore_BatchSize | **SHARED** - Transaction metadata batch size (shared with Block Validation service) |
| BlockStore | *url.URL | "file://./data/blockstore" | blockstore | Required when HTTP server enabled |

## Configuration Dependencies

### HTTP Server

- When `HTTPListenAddress` is not empty, HTTP server starts
- Requires valid `Block.BlockStore` URL or returns configuration error
- The blob API it exposes requires `Authorization: Bearer <HTTPAuthToken>` on POST, PATCH and
  DELETE. With `HTTPAuthToken` unset the API serves GET and HEAD only and refuses every
  mutating request with 401
- The endpoint is plain HTTP with no TLS, so the token crosses the wire in the clear. It
  binds to loopback by default for that reason; publish it only on a trusted segment
- Clients configure the same value with `blob_httpAuthToken`, never in the store URL — store
  URLs are logged verbatim

### Concurrency Management

- `Concurrency` reduced by half when `IsAllInOneMode` is true
- Minimum concurrency of 1 enforced

### Block Processing Strategy

- `PersistSleep` controls polling frequency when idle and after errors
- Database `persisted_at` column tracks which blocks have been persisted

### Transaction Processing

- Transaction metadata is always fetched in batches, sized by `ProcessTxMetaUsingStoreBatchSize`
- **Note**: `ProcessTxMetaUsingStoreBatchSize` uses the `blockvalidation_` prefix (not `blockpersister_`) as it's a shared setting with the Block Validation service. Both services use the same batch size for consistent transaction metadata processing.

### UTXO File Processing

- When `ProcessUTXOFiles` is true (default), generates `.utxo-additions` and `.utxo-deletions` files for each block
- These files are used by the UTXO Persister service to maintain UTXO sets
- Set to false to disable UTXO file generation for performance in scenarios where UTXO sets are not needed

## Service Dependencies

| Dependency | Interface | Usage |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| BlockStore | blob.Store | **CRITICAL** - Block data storage |
| SubtreeStore | blob.Store | **CRITICAL** - Subtree data storage |
| UTXOStore | utxo.Store | **CRITICAL** - UTXO operations and transaction metadata |
| BlockchainClient | blockchain.ClientI | **CRITICAL** - Block retrieval and operations |

## Validation Rules

| Setting | Validation | Error |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Block.BlockStore | Required when HTTP server enabled | "blockstore setting error" |
| Store | Must be valid URL format | Store creation failure |
| HTTPAuthToken | Required for any blob write over HTTP; unset leaves the API read-only | HTTP 401 Unauthorized |

## Configuration Examples

### Basic Configuration

```bash
blockpersister_store=file://./data/blockstore
blockpersister_persistSleep=10s
```

### High Performance Configuration

```bash
blockpersister_concurrency=16
blockvalidation_processTxMetaUsingStore_BatchSize=2048
```

### HTTP Server Configuration

```bash
blockpersister_httpListenAddress=127.0.0.1:8083
blockstore=file://./data/blockstore

# Required for writes. Set both in the environment and configure the same value on the
# client side. Values in settings files are masked in the startup dump but held in clear
# in the file; never put them in the committed settings.conf.
blockpersister_httpAuthToken=<shared-secret>
blob_httpAuthToken=<shared-secret>
```

### Disable UTXO File Processing

```bash
blockpersister_processUTXOFiles=false
```

## Migration Notes

### Listen Address Default

`blockpersister_httpListenAddress` now defaults to `127.0.0.1:8083` instead of `:8083`. The
endpoint is plain HTTP and its blob API accepts writes, so it no longer binds every interface
by default. A deployment that reaches this endpoint from another host must set the address
explicitly.

### Blob API writes require a token

POST, PATCH and DELETE on the blob HTTP API now return 401 until `blockpersister_httpAuthToken`
is set on the server and the same value is set as `blob_httpAuthToken` on each client. Reads
(GET, HEAD, `/health`) are unaffected.

The HTTP blob client reports a 401 as a configuration error. The pruner keeps deletions for that
store queued and logs an error on each pass until the tokens match, instead of retrying and
dropping them. Deletions for the other blob stores carry on.

### Overwrite over the HTTP blob API

`allowOverwrite` is sent only on a POST (`options.WithAllowOverwrite(true)`) and honoured only
for a caller presenting the matching token. An unauthenticated caller cannot write at all.
Without the flag, a write to a key that already exists is answered 409 and returned as
`ErrBlobAlreadyExists`.

Callers that replace blobs (the UTXO persister's `lastProcessed` marker, the set-hash sidecar,
checkpoints, seed packages, subtree re-writes, the peer registry snapshot) work over an
`http://` blob store once both tokens are set.

### Settings Reorganization

The Block Persister settings have been reorganized into a dedicated `BlockPersisterSettings` struct. The following environment variable names have changed:

| Old Variable | New Variable |
|--------------|--------------|
| blockPersisterStore | blockpersister_store |
| blockPersister_httpListenAddress | blockpersister_httpListenAddress |
| blockPersister_persistSleep | blockpersister_persistSleep |

### Removed Settings

The following settings have been **removed** in the current version as persistence state is now tracked in the database:

- `blockPersister_stateFile` - No longer needed, persistence tracked in database `persisted_at` column
- `blockpersister_persistAge` - No longer needed, blocks processed as soon as they're available
- `blockpersister_enableDefensiveReorgCheck` - No longer needed, reorg handling simplified

If you have these settings in your configuration files, they can be safely removed.
