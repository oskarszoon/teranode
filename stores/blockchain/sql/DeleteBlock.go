// DeleteBlock physically removes a single block row from the blocks table and
// invalidates the caches that depend on block rows. Idempotent: no error if
// the row did not exist.
//
// The blocks table has a self-referencing foreign key (parent_id REFERENCES
// blocks(id)) with no ON DELETE CASCADE, so callers must order deletions so
// that no surviving row still points at a deleted block. Rewind tooling
// achieves this by iterating in strict descending height order.
//
// Cache invalidation mirrors InvalidateBlock's defer block: after the row is
// deleted we clear the block-timestamp cache, reset the response cache that
// serves GetBestBlockHeader/GetBlockHeaders, reset the chain-walk cache if
// enabled, and trigger an async rebuild of the off-chain block-id set. The
// per-call cost is negligible (the caches use a generation counter), so
// callers deleting many blocks can do so without coordinating finalization
// — GetBestBlockHeader and friends see the new tip immediately.

	// changes which blocks are on the main chain. rebuildOffChainSet's contract note asks
	// for it and this was the one mutator not honouring it.
	//
	// Note what the guard cannot fix. updateMaxBlockID only ever moves the bound up, so a
	// deleted id stays at or below maxBlockID for the life of the process while its row is
	// gone, which is a gap id the in-memory route answers true for until restart. That is
	// safe today only because cmd/rewindblockchain is the sole non-test caller, it is a
	// separate binary that never serves CheckBlockIsInCurrentChain, and it deletes in
	// descending height order so the node restarts with maxBlockID back at the surviving
	// MAX(id). An in-process caller would need maxBlockID recomputed rather than advanced.
	//
	// The guard has a cost on a forked-set node: the rebuild below sees it and takes the
	// full-chain parent_id walk rather than the flat on_main_chain scan, so a rewind of N
	// blocks with the toggle on pays N walks. That is deliberate. DeleteBlock reconciles no
	// flags, so when the delete changes the best chain the flags the flat scan reads are
	// the old chain's. With the toggle off there is no rebuild, and the guard only moves
	// concurrent on_main_chain readers onto their flag-free walks for one DELETE.
