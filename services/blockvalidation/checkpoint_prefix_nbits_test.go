//
// The expected-nBits rule could be skipped for a block below the highest CONFIGURED checkpoint while
// the node was still building that prefix. Height below a checkpoint does not establish that a block
// is on the checkpointed chain, so the exemption was never sound — and neither of the two places
// that were supposed to cover it does:
//
//   - the direct peer path has no header-level difficulty pipeline at all;
//   - catch-up has one, but validateHeaderChainDifficulty DEFERS every header whose full 144-block
//     window is not inside the fetched run — the first header and roughly its first 146 successors —
//     naming this very check as the downstream cover for them. Narrowing the exemption to catch-up
//     therefore composed the two skips into a hole rather than closing it.
//
// Both subtests below assert the same thing from the two delivery shapes, and the catch-up one
// asserts the composition directly: the real precheck is run over the fetched header run and shown
// to PASS the bad chain, after which the body validator must be the thing that rejects it.
