// bindSubtreeBodyToHeader proves the peer-supplied body hashes to the header BEFORE
// any block-id assignment or UTXO mutation. It reads subtree structures, never
// subtree_data. Its only write is the quarantine of a blob that does not match its
// own key, and that happens at the caller's error boundary, not here.
//
// The binding cannot be moved inside the batch pipeline without giving up streaming:
// AssignBlockID runs inside the batch loop, after the first batch's read, so any
// check that only happens at batch-read time lands after a durable block-id
// reservation for every batch past the first. This pass runs the same checks on the
// whole block first, and holds only node hashes — 48 bytes per transaction — never a
// transaction body (bitcoin-sv/teranode#4838).
//
// That figure is the whole cost on every attempt, including a retry. A promoted
// FileTypeSubtree blob is still read and anchored by readSubtreeStructure when one is
// present, because anchoring it before the pipeline is the only pre-mutation check for
// a forged promoted blob beside an honest subtree_to_check — but this pass never reads
// its node list, so it releases it immediately rather than retaining a second copy of
// the block's nodes for the duration.
//
// It walks the block ONE CHUNK OF SUBTREES AT A TIME, releasing each chunk before
// reading the next. It used to read every subtree in the block at once at a hard-coded
// fan-out of 128, which bypassed the per-batch residency cap the pipeline exists to
// enforce: a catch-up block of several hundred million-node subtrees held tens of
// gigabytes of node data at once, and with mmapDir set one live mapping and one temp
// file per subtree, where the pipeline would have held one batch. What survives a chunk
// is 32 bytes of root per subtree plus the running duplicate-transaction set.
//
// The chunk width is the pipeline's own SubtreeBatchSize, so the pass's node-list
// residency cannot exceed one pipeline batch; the running txid set is whole-block and
// is the one term that grows with the block.
//
// Handing these anchored structures forward to the pipeline instead — so it need not
// re-read them — was considered and rejected. It cannot fix the residency: it EXTENDS
// it, from "until this function returns" to "until the last batch leaves stage 3". The
// duplicate structure read the pipeline then performs is the deliberate price of
// binding the whole block before the first batch mutates anything; the two pull in
// opposite directions and this is the chosen side (bitcoin-sv/teranode#4838). What can
// be removed without moving any anchor is removed — see readSubtreeStructure's two

// failing reads survives as the error to return, and it may be an ordinary mismatch
// while a different hash was the one whose sibling could not be read. Carrying only
// that first error's own markers would drop the fail-closed verdict: the named blobs
// would delete cleanly, the boundary would report success, and the attempt would fall
// through to normal validation with an unaudited blob still on disk — which is exactly
// the outcome the marker exists to prevent.
//
// otherErr is whichever read failed FIRST, mismatch or not, and it is joined in rather
// than discarded. The two can differ: a subtree can be missing or unreadable in the
// same pass in which a different one fails its anchor, and the anchor verdict is the
// one preferred as the outer error because it is what carries the quarantine. Dropping
// the other left an ErrNotFound invisible to both the log and any errors.Is
// classification downstream, so an attempt that was partly an infrastructure failure
// read as a pure blob forgery. The mismatch stays outermost, so the quarantine refs
// and the fail-closed marker are still read from the top of the chain; the other
// becomes a reachable cause.
//
// Reachable by every errors.Is classification, IsBlockCorrupt included. When the
// other failure is itself a corrupt-body verdict — readSubtree rejects a coinbase
// placeholder outside [0][0] that way — the combined error is corrupt, and
// tryQuickValidation, which tests IsBlockCorrupt before isUnquarantinedLocalSubtree,
// takes its corrupt branch: the catch-up primary is struck and the run aborts for a
// re-download. That is the disposition the corrupt fault gets on its own, the

// structures against the requested hash, and a subtree_data body against the nodes of
