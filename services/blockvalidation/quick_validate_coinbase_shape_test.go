// CheckCoinbaseOnlyBodyBound ties a no-subtree body to its header, but it does not say
// the single transaction in that body is coinbase-shaped. The quick path's own coinbase
// checks are len(Inputs) != 0 (BlockIncomplete) and the scriptSig length bound, neither
// of which rejects an ordinary spend standing in for the coinbase.
//
// The check belongs AFTER the binding: once the header commits to this transaction, a
// non-coinbase one is the miner's own committed body and so genuinely invalid. Ahead of
// the binding the same failure would be indistinguishable from a corrupted download,
// which is the classification bitcoin-sv/teranode#4692 settled.

// buildBoundNonCoinbaseBody builds a coinbase-only block whose only transaction is a
// normal spend, with the header merkle root set to that txid so the body is genuinely
// bound.
