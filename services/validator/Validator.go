	// client-level timeouts: the primary SpendAndCreate below, and the store reads and
	// writes on the error and duplicate paths — the GetMeta after ErrTxExists, the
	// conflicting-path CreateInUtxoStore and its GetMeta, MarkConflictingRecursively,
	// and the GetMeta on the not-found path.
	//
	// The exposure is real rather than theoretical. Before this context was detached,
	// process shutdown could eventually interrupt those calls; now nothing outside the
	// store can. Aerospike mitigates with its own TotalTimeout/SocketTimeout, but the
	// SQL/Postgres store applies no per-operation deadline of its own, so a wedged
	// non-Aerospike store can retain an ingest goroutine indefinitely on those seams.
	//
	// SpendAndCreate is not bounded here because it is the acceptance operation, not
	// bookkeeping: a deadline on it changes acceptance semantics under load — a
	// slow-but-healthy store during a burst would start failing transactions — and it
	// would fire mid-operation into the store's own spend-rollback-on-create-failure
	// path. Sizing that deadline needs a load trace, so it is recorded here as a known
	// gap rather than guessed at.
	//
	// Read the list above as a REGRESSION relative to the pre-detach behaviour on the
	// default (tracing-disabled) configuration, not merely as a pre-existing gap:
	// before the detach, process shutdown could eventually interrupt those calls, and
	// now nothing outside the store can. Two remedies are candidates, and both are
	// DEFERRED rather than guessed at here, each blocked on something this change does
	// not have:
	//
	//   - A deadline on SpendAndCreate. Blocked on sizing, for the reason above: it is
	//     the acceptance operation, so a deadline changes acceptance semantics under
	//     load, and sizing it needs a load trace.
	//   - Narrowing the WithoutCancel scope to begin after SpendAndCreate returns.
	//     Blocked on semantics: the conflicting path lives inside SpendAndCreate's
	//     error handling, so that puts MarkConflictingRecursively back on a cancellable
	//     context, where a mid-walk cancellation leaves a partially-marked descendant
	//     set. Whether an interrupted walk is better than a slow one needs data this
	//     change does not have either.
	//
	// Neither is tracked by anything this comment can point at, so it does not claim
	// one is: the exposure is stated here so the next reader inherits the reasoning
	// rather than re-deriving it.

// block-assembly server from parking this goroutine — and, on the Kafka ingest path,
// the record batch it holds — indefinitely. Applying it here rather than at each call
// site covers the first hand-off and every retry from one place.
//
// The deadline is UNCONDITIONAL by design, including when
// blockassembly_maxQueueItems = 0 (the shipped default) where no shed can occur and
// it therefore buys no shed classification. Gating it on a positive cap looks like
// the proportionate thing to do and is not: because the context arriving here is
// detached, this deadline is the ONLY bound in existence on the hand-off. Gating it
// would leave a default deployment with a hand-off that is both unbounded AND
// uncancellable, so a wedged block-assembly server would park the ingest goroutine
// and its pinned Kafka record batch forever — strictly worse than the pre-detach
// state and than the current one.
//
// What it costs on a default deployment is real and is not closed here: a
// healthy-but-slow batcher can exceed the floor, the transaction is left Locked, its
// descendants burn validator_txlocked_maxRetries and are lost, and a synchronous
// submitter gets a 500. The operator lever is validator_handoffRoundTripSlack, which
// widens the floor without limit; its longdesc names this case.
//
// The two modes are bounded, but they are not semantically identical:
//
//   - Unary mode: the deadline cancels the in-flight gRPC call, so the transaction was
//     not accepted by block assembly.
//   - Batch mode (blockassembly_sendBatchSize > 0, the shipped default): the deadline
//     abandons the WAIT but not the item. The batcher may still dispatch it, so the
//     transaction MAY STILL REACH block assembly.
//
// That difference is why a deadline failure is deliberately never treated as a shed
// and never unwound — deleting the record of a transaction that is still in flight
// could remove one already in a subtree or a template. See the context.DeadlineExceeded

//     transaction is stranded locked. Hence the floor is the remote's wait plus
//     handoffRoundTripSlack (validator_handoffRoundTripSlack).
//  2. Subject to (1), the ingest hand-off should not outlast the retry window that
//     BlockAssemblyShedRetryTimeout advertises. Validate subtracts this floor from
//     that window, so the window and one final in-flight attempt together stay within
//     it.
//
// (1) wins when they conflict, because losing the shed classification is a correctness
// failure while overshooting the window is a bounded resource overshoot on a path
// already documented as a time bound rather than a memory bound. New logs a warning
// when the configured window cannot accommodate one attempt, so the effective bound is
// never a surprise.
//
// Cross-process caveat: BlockAssembly.QueueFullWaitTimeout read here is THIS process's

// sizes a safety margin only and never feeds a control decision, which is why the
// queue-stats RPC's self-reporting treatment (used for DoubleSpendWindow, where a
// wrong value could invert the decision) is not replicated for it. If the local copy

//	                    unmined reload can still lift into a mining template. That
//	                    is an invalid template: consensus-visible.
//	Delete -> Unspend   record T is gone while its inputs still read spent-by-T.
//	                    If the Unspend then fails those UTXOs are temporarily
//	                    unspendable, but no record can re-enter a template. An
//	                    operator can recover from the logged outpoints. Never
//	                    consensus-visible.
//
// # Verify-after-delete
//
// The ordering argument only holds if the delete actually deleted. This method
// holds a utxo.Store INTERFACE and calls DeleteComplete (the cascading delete that
// removes the master record first, then the pagination children and the external
// blob, so a paginated transaction leaves nothing behind); its nil return is only as
// trustworthy as the concrete implementation behind the interface. A decorator
// could report success without the record having actually left the store — a cache
// layer whose delete only touches its own cache is the illustrative case.
// Trusting a nil return there would convert the safe intermediate state into the
// dangerous one while believing it succeeded. So the record is read back, and
// anything other than "genuinely gone" aborts before unspending — a generic guard
// that holds for every decorator in the stack, including ones not yet written.
//
// On the created-record shape the read-back runs TWICE, and the second one answers a
// different question. The first establishes that the delete reached the record. The
// second, immediately before the unspend, establishes that the record has not come
// BACK: the delete writes no tombstone, so a concurrent submission of the same txid
// recreates it and its spends are indistinguishable from this call's own. Everything
// between the two reads — the cascade's child passes, the blob deletes, the bounded
// verify retries — is time during which that can happen, so a single read taken
// before all of it is not a basis for freeing the inputs. A residual window remains
// between the second read and the unspend completing; closing that needs per-txid
// serialisation of create, hand-off and unwind, which this does not have.
//
// On the spend-only shape (SkipUtxoCreation) there is no delete to confirm, so only
// the second read runs, and it answers the question that shape poses instead: this
// call created nothing, so any record present for this txid belongs to a submission
// this call does not own, and its inputs must not be freed.
//
// # The same rule applies inside the cascade
//
// DeleteComplete removes the MASTER record first and its pagination children and
// external blob(s) after, for the reason above one level down: the master is the
// only record that can be lifted into a mining template, so it must be the first
// thing to go. The reverse order (children first) leaves, on any failure, a master
// whose outputs live on records that no longer exist — a transaction this node will
// mine and then refuse to serve most of the outputs of, and whose missing children
// nothing in the node recreates.
//
// What a failed cascade can leave instead is orphan pagination children: locked,
// therefore unspendable, no longer enumerable (the child count lived on the master),
// and adopted by a later create of the same txid, which restores a coherent record.
// The trade is deliberate: unreachable residue over wrongly reachable residue.
//
// # Why an inconclusive read fails CLOSED
//
// A read that errors does not establish that the record survived — but it equally
// does not establish that it is gone, and the two candidate outcomes are not
// symmetric:
//
//	fail open (unspend anyway)   worst case: the record survived AND its inputs are
//	                             free, so a competing double-spend takes them while
//	                             the survivor can still be lifted into a template.
//	                             Consensus-visible, network-visible.
//	fail closed (abort)          worst case: the record is gone and its inputs read
//	                             spent by a transaction that no longer exists. Those
//	                             outpoints are unspendable until an operator acts on
//	                             the log line below, which names every one of them.
//	                             Node-local, never consensus-visible.
//
// Under uncertainty the branch whose worst case is node-local and recoverable wins,
// and that does not change because the probability shifts. What does change is the
// size of the window: the read is retried (shedUnwindVerifyAttempts) before being
// treated as inconclusive, which converts most transient store errors into a
// definitive answer.
//
// Aborting leaves the transaction as the shed found it (present, Locked, inputs
// spent) whenever the record is still readable — under the master-first cascade
// that means the master delete itself failed and nothing else was touched, so the
// unmined reload is still the backstop it always was. The read-back is what
// establishes which case this is, which is why it runs even when the delete
// reported an error. That makes the unwind correct through every decorator in the
// stack, including ones not yet written, at the cost of one GetMeta on a path that
// only runs when the node is already shedding.
//
// # Preconditions, each naming the code that enforces it
//
//   - Only this call's own work is ever undone: on the created-record shape the
//     already-exists branch returns before the hand-off, so an existing record
//     from another submitter is unreachable from here; on the spend-only shape
//     the record gate immediately before the unspend is what enforces it.
//
//     Read that in one direction only. It means this call never undoes another
//     submitter's STORE WORK. The converse is NOT claimed: a concurrent duplicate
//     of the same txid that took the already-exists early return in Validate was
//     told the transaction was accepted without performing a hand-off of its own,
//     and this unwind then removes the record it was told about. See the residual
//     bullet below, which is the same root cause.
//
//   - No descendant can have spent T's outputs, because no block-context
//     validation reaches here: a shed whose options carry InBlock returns at the
//     block-context arm in Validate instead of unwinding. Locked is NOT what
//     gives that: spends carrying utxo.WithIgnoreLocked(true) do exist, on exactly
//     the block-context paths (subtree validation's per-subtree and levelled
//     pipelines, and both CheckSubtree branches), so a descendant arriving in a
//     peer subtree can and does spend a Locked parent's outputs.
//
//   - Only the addToBlockAssembly branch reaches this, which is the only path
//     that can produce a shed. Setting AddTXToBlockAssembly=false is one way a
//     caller avoids the hand-off altogether, not the guarantee — several
//     block-context callers leave it at its true default.
//
//   - The unspend runs only once the store has been proved to hold no record for
//     this txid, on BOTH shapes. On the created-record shape that proves the
//     record has not come back after the delete; on the spend-only shape
//     (SkipUtxoCreation) it proves no record this call did not create owns these
//     spends — SpendingData is {txid, vin}, so the store's ownership check cannot
//     tell two submissions of the same txid apart. The spend set is never empty on
//     the spend-only shape (SpendOnly returns the spends and nil metadata), so "an
//     empty spend set is a no-op" is not the argument and never was.
//
//   - The unwind is NOT serialised against a concurrent submission of the same
//     txid: there is no per-txid lock and the delete leaves no tombstone, so a
//     resubmission can recreate the record and take ownership of spends that are
//     byte-identical to ours. The gate immediately before the unspend narrows that
//     window to one store round trip; it does not eliminate it, and
//     shed_unwind_reappeared_total is what makes the remainder observable. This is
//     stated as a residual, not claimed as safe.
//
//     The inverse of the same missing serialisation, and the more consequential
//     half: a duplicate submitted while this call sits between SpendAndCreate and
//     its hand-off takes the already-exists early return, is answered SUCCESS with
//     no hand-off of its own, and then has its transaction deleted by this unwind.
//     Nothing resubmits it. It is bounded — a shed requires
//     blockassembly_maxQueueItems > 0 — and it is not silent: this call's record is
//     Locked and unmined when the duplicate reads it, so the duplicate takes the
//     locked-unmined arm in Validate, which increments
//     teranode_validator_existing_tx_locked_unmined_total and logs the txid. That
//     counter is the field measure of how often this shape occurs. The remedy is
//     the same per-txid serialisation of create, hand-off and unwind named above;
//     refusing the duplicate instead is the wrong trade, because a locked-unmined
//     record has causes an honest resubmit must not be failed on (see the
//     ErrTxExists comment in Validate).
//
// Failure is best-effort and never fatal: every arm logs the txid AND the outpoints
// and meters. What it falls back to depends on where the delete failed: while the
// master record is still present the transaction is left Locked for the unmined reload,
// but once the master is gone there is nothing left to leave Locked — the inputs are
// then unspent unless that unspend itself fails, and only unreachable residue (orphan
// pagination children, an external blob) can survive, counted by
// shed_unwind_residue_total. The error returned to the validation caller stays the
// shed in every case, so the 503 mapping is unchanged. The returned error is for
// callers that want to observe the unwind outcome; the shed path deliberately
// ignores it.
//
// The context is bounded by shedUnwindTimeout (validator_shedUnwindTimeout), because
// the one it inherits is detached from the caller and a wedged store would otherwise
// park an ingest goroutine on a best-effort cleanup path. That bound is ONE budget for
// the whole sequence — the cascade, BOTH verify passes and the unspend together — so a
// slow store spends it on the earlier phases and each pass can get fewer attempts than
// shedUnwindVerifyAttempts before failing closed. The second pass is the one that goes
// first: the cascade and the first pass can consume the budget between them, cutting it
// short entirely. The cascade's opening master read is bounded by aerospike_readPolicy
// rather than by this deadline, because the client ignores the context on that call.

	//  - Keeps the MTP store and EnsureMTPLoaded pre-warming entirely out

	//  - Per-tx policy-mode MTP lookups (synchronous gRPC / DB I/O per
	//    peer tx) are avoided. Consensus mode amortises a single
	//    EnsureMTPLoaded call across an entire block of txs validated
