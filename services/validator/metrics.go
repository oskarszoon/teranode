/*
Package validator implements comprehensive BSV Blockchain transaction validation functionality
for the Teranode blockchain node. This service provides critical validation operations
including transaction structure validation, script execution, UTXO verification, and
consensus rule enforcement to ensure blockchain integrity and compliance.

The validator service integrates with multiple Teranode components:
- UTXO store for unspent transaction output verification
- Script engine for Bitcoin script execution and validation
- Block processor for coordinated validation workflows
- Mempool for transaction pre-validation before block inclusion

This metrics.go file implements Prometheus metrics collection for the validator service,
providing detailed monitoring and observability of transaction validation operations.
The metrics track performance, error rates, validation times, and resource utilization
to enable comprehensive monitoring of the validation pipeline's health and efficiency.

Key metrics categories include:
- Health check monitoring and service availability
- Transaction validation performance and timing
- Script validation execution metrics
- Batch processing performance tracking
- UTXO operations and database interactions
- Error rates and validation failure analysis

	// guarantees is an error log carrying the txid and the outpoints; what it no
	// longer implies on its own is that the transaction was left locked or its
	// inputs left spent.
	//
	// It counts UNWINDS, not failing operations: one unwind moves it by at most one,
	// including on the residue arm where the delete failed and the unspend then
	// failed too. That is what keeps it comparable against shed_unwind_total and
	// pairable with the residue, aborted and unverified counters — the arithmetic
	// the metrics reference asks operators to do.
	prometheusValidatorShedUnwindFailures prometheus.Counter

	// prometheusValidatorShedUnwindAborted counts unwinds abandoned by the
	// verify-after-delete guard because the store reported a successful delete but the
	// record was still readable. Kept distinct from the failure counter so "the store
	// did not honour Delete" is visibly different from "the unspend failed", and
	// distinct from the unverified counter below because this one is a store-contract
	// violation an operator fixes by wiring, not by reconciling outpoints.
	prometheusValidatorShedUnwindAborted prometheus.Counter

	// prometheusValidatorShedUnwindUnverified counts unwinds abandoned because the
	// record's absence could not be CONFIRMED after the bounded retry — a read that
	// kept failing, rather than a record that was still there. It covers both
	// read-back rounds, the one after the delete and the one before the unspend. The
	// inputs are left spent by a record whose deletion is unconfirmed; the error log
	// carries the txid and the outpoints to reconcile from.
	prometheusValidatorShedUnwindUnverified prometheus.Counter

	// prometheusValidatorShedUnwindResidue counts unwinds whose complete delete
	// failed AFTER the master record had already gone: nothing mineable survives
	// and the inputs are safely unspent, but orphan pagination children and/or an
	// external blob may remain. Counted in addition to shed_unwind_failures_total,
	// which is the "the delete failed at all" signal.
	prometheusValidatorShedUnwindResidue prometheus.Counter

	// prometheusValidatorShedDroppedTotal counts transactions dropped after the
	// bounded block-assembly handoff retry on the Kafka ingest path. Propagation has
	// already returned success to the submitter by then, so these drops are silent
	// from the client's point of view — this is the counter to alert on.
	prometheusValidatorShedDroppedTotal prometheus.Counter

	// prometheusValidatorShedInBlockDroppedTotal counts block-context transactions
	// accepted without a block-assembly template entry because the ingest queue was
	// full. The transaction is valid, unlocked and spendable; it is simply not
	// mineable by this node until the next unmined reload, which nothing schedules,
	// so a rising value is the signal that a block-assembly reset would recover
	// template entries this node is otherwise missing.
	prometheusValidatorShedInBlockDroppedTotal prometheus.Counter

	// prometheusValidatorShedUnwindReappeared counts shed unwinds aborted because the
	// record was CONCLUSIVELY readable again immediately before the unspend: another
	// submission of the same txid now owns those spends, and clearing them would free
	// the inputs of a live transaction. A pre-unspend read that merely kept failing is
	// shed_unwind_unverified_total instead, so this counter stays a clean signal that
	// concurrent same-txid submissions are real in this deployment.
	prometheusValidatorShedUnwindReappeared prometheus.Counter

	// prometheusValidatorShedUnwindUnownedRecord counts shed unwinds aborted on the
	// spend-only (SkipUtxoCreation) shape because a record this call did not create is
	// present, so its inputs must not be freed. Kept apart from the reappearance
	// counter deliberately: that one means a record came back after this call deleted
	// it, while this one means a record was there all along — a different operator
	// problem, and folding them would destroy the reappearance counter as the signal
	// that per-txid serialisation is needed.
	prometheusValidatorShedUnwindUnownedRecord prometheus.Counter

	// prometheusValidatorHandoffDeadlineTotal counts block-assembly handoffs that hit
	// the validator's own handoff deadline instead of returning a shed or a success. A
	// recurring non-zero value points at a settings skew between this process's copy of
	// blockassembly_queueFullWaitTimeout and the value the block-assembly process
	// enforces: the deadline then fires before the shed arrives, so the shed is neither
	// classified nor unwound and the transaction is left locked for the unmined reload.
	prometheusValidatorHandoffDeadlineTotal prometheus.Counter

	// prometheusValidatorExistingTxLockedUnmined counts resubmits that found an
	// existing record locked, unmined and not conflicting — the residual stranded
	// state. Field data from this counter is what should decide whether that state
	// ever needs a behavioural answer, since the store cannot distinguish its
	// causes.
