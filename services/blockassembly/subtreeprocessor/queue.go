	// one-directional rule is what makes the multi-producer race safe: with the
	// latch at 0, producer A can link the true (older) head yet producer B links
	// behind it and wins the store first; a plain CAS-from-0 would then leave B's
	// LATER time and under-report the backlog age (the dangerous direction — the
	// backpressure controller would fail to pause). Here A's corrective CAS(tB, tA)
	// still lowers the latch to its older time, so it converges to the OLDEST
	// pending time. A read landing in the gap between B's store and A's corrective
	// CAS still sees the younger tB — a transient under-report — but that gap is one
	// producer's own straight-line path from link to this loop (no I/O, lock or
	// early return) and self-heals on A's very next CAS: a different class from the
	// persistent, consumer-cadence-bounded under-report a plain CAS-from-0 leaves.
	//
	// batch.time is stamped before tail.Swap, so a stalled producer can carry a
	// time earlier than the batch actually linked ahead of it; pulling the latch to
	// that earlier time is an OVER-report (age reads older than the true head),
	// bounded by the producers' inter-arrival gap and corrected by the consumer's
	// next updateOldestPending. Over-report is the safe direction.
	//
	// The loop is lock-free and terminates: the common case (non-empty queue, this
	// batch newer than the head) breaks on the first load with no store; a store
	// runs only on the empty transition or a rarer out-of-order timestamp, and each
	// failed CAS re-reads a latch another writer already moved toward this target or
	// to 0, so progress is bounded by the finite set of concurrent writers.
	//
	// An empty queue is covered separately by the headAgeMillis clamp, which reads
	// 0 whenever queueLength is 0, so a stale non-zero latch left on an empty queue
	// (e.g. a CAS that landed just after a drain) is never observed while it stays
	// empty — including for the whole of a dequeue-free state transition. Should a
	// batch then arrive while such a stale OLDER latch is still set, min-CAS leaves
	// it (it only lowers), so the age reads slightly old: an OVER-report, the safe
	// direction, bounded and cleared by the consumer's next updateOldestPending.

// enqueueBatch adds a batch of transactions to the queue unconditionally,

//
// Reserving before publishing upholds the queueLength >= published-outstanding
// invariant on this path too: the counter is bumped before the batch is linked,
// so its only transient miscount is an OVER-count (counter high for the brief
// window before the link lands), never an under-count (counter reading below the
// published count). That direction is load-bearing because queueLength is read as
// an empty oracle — headAgeMillis clamps to 0 when it reads 0 — so it must never
// read 0 while a batch is linked. Every other consumer (the state-transition
// drain snapshot, the diagnostic gauges and RPCs) already tolerates a transient
// one-batch over-count. Callers that need the bound must use enqueueBatchIfRoom.

// enqueueBatchIfRoom adds a batch only if doing so would not push the number of
// published-or-reserved items past maxItems, and reports whether it did.
//
// The bound is enforced by an atomic reservation, not a load-then-compare: the
// batch's items are added to queueLength first, and only published if the
// post-add value is within the limit; otherwise the reservation is rolled back
// and nothing is published. Because reservations are totally ordered by the
// atomic and the counter decreases only by dequeue of published items or by
// rollback of a failed reservation, the published-but-not-yet-dequeued item
// count can never exceed maxItems even with many concurrent producers. A
// load-then-compare would not be a bound under the multi-producer contract,
// because two producers could both observe room and both publish.
//
// This reservation-first ordering is also what upholds the
// queueLength >= published-outstanding invariant: the counter is incremented
// before the batch is linked, so it never reads below the published count. The
// unbounded enqueueBatch path now shares that ordering (see its comment).
//
// When maxItems <= 0 the queue is unbounded and this degrades to enqueueBatch.
//
// # A batch larger than the whole cap is admitted alone onto an empty queue
//
// Such a batch can never satisfy a reservation, on any queue state, so refusing it
// is permanent rather than transient: that producer never makes progress and its
// bounded wait plus the hard shed simply run forever. The batch size is chosen by
// the client from its own settings context, so this is reachable by cross-process
// configuration skew and not only by a local mistake. Admitting it when the
// reservation found the queue otherwise empty trades a transient one-batch overshoot
// of the ceiling for liveness, which is the same trade enqueueBatch already makes.
//
// The overshoot is bounded to ONE batch: the emptiness test reads after-n from the
// same atomic Add that made the reservation, not from a separate load, so of any
// number of concurrent over-size producers exactly one can observe 0.
//
// The n > maxItems guard keeps this from becoming a general "an empty queue admits
// anything" carve-out: an ordinary over-cap batch is still refused and still relies
// on the bounded wait and the shed.
