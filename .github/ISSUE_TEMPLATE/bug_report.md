## Severity

Project policy is to tick exactly one (see the [severity criteria](https://github.com/bsv-blockchain/teranode/blob/main/docs/howto/bugReporting.md#severity)):

- [ ] severity:critical — consensus failure, data loss or corruption, funds at risk, or a node that cannot sync or stay up. Impact alone decides this level; an available workaround does not downgrade it
- [ ] severity:major — a core function is broken or badly degraded (sustained throughput loss, a service needing manual restarts), but a workaround exists
- [ ] severity:minor — cosmetic, documentation, or low-impact issues with an easy workaround
